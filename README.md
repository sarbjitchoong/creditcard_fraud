# ðŸ’³ CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
### Machine Learning

### â˜… GOAL

Banks and credit card companies want to stop fraud from happening to their customers. As more and more people buy things online, it's important to have a good system in place to catch fraud. That's why they're working on a project to make their fraud detection better. 

The goal of this project is to make a system that can tell when someone is using a credit card fraudulently, so that the real card owner is not charged for something they didn't buy. The system uses regression models to look at the credit card data and figure out if there's something suspicious going on. Regression appraoches are utilized to analyze transaction data, identify patterns, and predict the likelihood of fraudulent activity.

By constantly checking credit card transactions as they happen, the system can quickly tell the bank or credit card company if something seems wrong. This helps protect the customer's money and keeps the whole financial system honest.
